## Module 0: Who this handbook is for?
- Project Overview

- Purpose and Objectives
  -- Providing valuable skills and knowledge to projects and community leaders in DEI, meeting a recognized need within NumFOCUS.

- Target Audience
  -- OSS Maintainers, Sustainers, and Leadership

## Module 1: Introduction to DEI in Open Source
- Defining Diversity, Inclusivity and Equity: Clarification of key terms such as inclusivity and equity.
> Example: Providing definitions of equity and inclusivity in the context of open-source communities.

**Diversity**: Diversity means having a variety of different people with various backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics, such as race, gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and abilities. 
**Equity**: Equity talks about removing barriers and providing support to ensure that everyone, regardless of their differences, has fair and equal opportunities and access to resources.
**Inclusion**: Inclusion means creating an environment where all individuals, irrespective of their differences feel welcomed, valued, and respected. 

DEI talks about embracing and valuing differences, ensuring fairness, and creating a sense of belonging for all people, no matter who they are or where they come from. Since Open-source software relies on collaboration, transparency, and community engagement, DEI principles are a crucial element in the health of open-source projects.

- Understanding the Importance of DEI in Open Source: Explanation of why Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are critical in open-source projects.
>Example: Discussing how diverse perspectives lead to more robust and innovative solutions in open-source software development.

- Benefits of Diverse and Inclusive Communities: Exploring the advantages of having diverse contributors and an inclusive community.
> Example: Highlighting research that shows how diverse teams are more creative and better at problem-solving.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open-source projects will foster innovation, ensure representation, broaden the user base, facilitate community growth, reduce bias and discrimination, and have a global impact. [GitHub's 2017 survey](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/) found that open-source projects with more diverse contributor teams are more likely to be successful.

Studies like the [DIAL initiative](https://dial.global/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GenderOSS_v10_PDF.pdf) (Digital Impact Alliance) emphasize how empowering and encouraging more women to participate in open source women drives healthy, inclusive engagement.

A research report by the [World Economic Forum](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/Thought-Leadership-Assets/PDF-2/Accenture-Getting-To-Equal-2020-Research-Report.pdf) underscores the profound significance of fostering diversity and inclusion within the workplace. This study also highlights that proactively embracing DEI practices unlocks the full potential of an organization, drives innovation, and maintains a competitive advantage in today's global marketplace
